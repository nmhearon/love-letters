		I tried to see you through my windows, but had to use a mac until I got the workarounds figured out.  While at first you made me nervous, I've grown to realize how easy you can make things.  When I open command prompt, I call your name "<span class=wordemphasis>bash</span>".  Sometimes I get confused about where we are in our relationship, but <span class="wordemphasis">pwd</span> always lets me know exactly where we are.  Together, we can see the world around <del>us</del><ins><span class="wordemphasis">ls</span></ins>.
