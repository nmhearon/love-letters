		I tried to see you through my windows, but had to use a mac until I figured out how I could get to you.  While at first you made me nervous, I've grown to realize how easy you can make things.  When I open command prompt, I call your name "<abbr title="Bourne Again Shell"><span class=wordemphasis>bash</span></abbr>".  Sometimes I get confused about where we are in our relationship, but <abbr title="Print Working Directory"><span class="wordemphasis">pwd</span></abbr> always lets me know exactly where we are.  Together, we can see the world around <del>us</del> <ins><abbr title="List Files in Working Directory"><span class="wordemphasis">ls</span></abbr></ins>.  All I have to do is pop in a <abbr title="Change Directory"><span class="wordemphasis">cd</span></abbr>, and you're my copilot getting me to where I wanna go.  But with <abbr title="Make Directory"><span class="wordemphasis">mkdir</span></abbr> we can build our own place.  And then when we finally made our own place, I can <abbr title="Create a New File in the Current Directory"><span class="wordemphasis">touch</span></abbr> you.html and when I do we've created a whole new file together.
		<br>
		<br>
		And while you can do so many useful things like that, you can also make me laugh with all your little tricks.  With <span class="wordemphasis">telnet blinkenlights.nl</span> you're playing Star Wars; with no words unfortunately, but Star Wars nonetheless.  And if I ever need <abbr title="Command for Help with Commands"><span class="wordemphasis">help</span></abbr>, I know it's only four letters away.
