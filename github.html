			<h2>Dear GitHub,</h2>
				<p>
					I have to say, I felt a little strange having to make an online account, but it was all worth it to get to you.  Although we met online, you and I quickly became friends locally.  One of the first things we did together was <span class="wordemphasis">create a repository</span> to share all of our information together.  And now that I know how well we fit together, I'm constantly <span class="wordemphasis">commiting</span> to you.  All I have to do is <span class="wordemphasis">git push</span> all of my new memories and information to our repository and by simply entering my username and password, you accept everything I have to say.  And while online dating isn't always the coolest option, somehow I feel like it's the only way I would've wanted to be with you.  But a lot of people can't always understand that concept, and that why we have our <span class="wordemphasis">README.me</span>.  And while I must admit that I was hesitant to learn how to speak in <span class="wordemphasis">markdown language</span>, it was really easy to grasp and I'm thankful I did.  I'm looking forward to a long and collaborative future together <pre><3</pre>.
