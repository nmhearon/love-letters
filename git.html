	<h1>Dear Git,</h1>
	<section class="container">
		<p>While I've never been horrible at keeping track of all the changes in my life (and code), you certainly make things easier.  All it takes is a little <span class="wordemphasis">git init</span> to turn you right on.  And once I do, a simple <span class="wordemphasis">"git add ."</span> is enough for you to recognize all the changes I'm making.  When you want to make notes entailing our story together, you can always <span class="wordemphasis">git commit</span> them right to memory, and for special events, <span class="wordemphasis">-m "will help you to write a special note to yourself recounting the details"</span>.  But of course, couples need to check in with each other every now and then, and <span class="wordemphasis"> git status </span>helps me to know exactly how you're doing and if you're keeping up to date with me.  Whenever I want to remember all the good times we've shared, <span class="wordemphasis">git log</span> shows me everything we've been through together.  And while we both may have different branches of our lives, we can always make a new one together with <span class="wordemphasis">git branch name</span> a new one for ourselves.  And once we decide things are going well enough, with a simple <span class="wordemphasis">git merge branches</span> we can take our separate branches and make them one to share everything that we have together.  <span class="wordemphasis"> git push</span> will allow us to share our union and contributions to each other with the world thanks to our dear friend GitHub.  And if there comes a sad day where we no longer see ourselves together, <span class="wordemphasis">git branch -D</span> will delete our history completely, and <span class="wordemphasis">git checkout</span> allows us to revert to our lives before we made all our changes together.  But I hope our bond is one that will never break.
